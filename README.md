# Climate Change Awareness and Engagement Toolkit for Saudi Arabia

## Project Purpose

This project aims to develop a comprehensive national "Climate Change Awareness and Engagement Toolkit" that supports the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly Article 6 (Education, Training, and Public Awareness), while aligning with the strategic objectives of Saudi Vision 2030 and the Saudi Green Initiative. The toolkit will provide accessible, culturally relevant educational resources to enhance public understanding of climate change, foster informed decision-making, and encourage active participation in climate action across all segments of society.

## UNFCCC Article 6 Obligations

Article 6 of the UNFCCC mandates that Parties, in carrying out their commitments under Article 4, paragraph 1(i), shall:

- **Promote and facilitate** at the national, subregional, and regional levels, within their respective capacities and in accordance with national laws and regulations:
  1. The development and implementation of educational and public awareness programmes on climate change and its effects.
  2. Public access to information on climate change and its effects.
  3. Public participation in addressing climate change and developing adequate responses.
  4. Training of scientific, technical, and managerial personnel.

- **Cooperate** in and promote, at the international level (where appropriate, using existing bodies):
  1. The development and exchange of educational and public awareness materials on climate change and its effects.
  2. The development and implementation of education and training programmes, including strengthening national institutions and the exchange or secondment of personnel to train experts, especially in developing countries.

These obligations form the core foundation for the toolkit, ensuring that Saudi Arabia's climate communication strategy meets international standards and promotes inclusive, participatory engagement.

## Alignment with Saudi Vision 2030 and Saudi Green Initiative

The toolkit directly supports several key objectives of Saudi Vision 2030 and the Saudi Green Initiative:

1. **Reducing Carbon Emissions** – The Saudi Green Initiative targets a reduction of 278 million tons of CO₂ equivalent per annum by 2030. The toolkit will educate citizens on the importance of emission reductions and how individual and collective actions contribute to this goal.

2. **Expanding Afforestation and Ecosystem Protection** – With a goal of planting 10 billion trees and protecting 30% of Saudi Arabia’s land and sea area by 2030, the toolkit will raise awareness about the role of nature‑based solutions, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable land‑use practices.

3. **Promoting a Green Economy and Renewable Energy Transition** – Vision 2030 envisions a diversified, sustainable economy. The toolkit will explain the benefits of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and circular economy principles, empowering the public to support and participate in the Kingdom’s green transition.

4. **Fostering Public Awareness and Youth Engagement** – The establishment of the annual Saudi Green Initiative Day (27 March) highlights the importance of public mobilization. The toolkit will provide materials for schools, universities, and community groups to actively engage youth and the wider public in climate‑action initiatives.

## Primary Target Audience

The toolkit is designed to serve a broad spectrum of Saudi society, with a primary focus on:

- **High‑school students** – As future leaders, students need a solid foundation in climate science, impacts, and solutions.
- **University students and young professionals** – This group can drive innovation, research, and advocacy for climate‑smart policies and practices.
- **General public** – Including families, community leaders, and civil‑society organizations, to ensure widespread understanding and participation in national climate efforts.

Secondary audiences include educators, government officials, media professionals, and private‑sector stakeholders who can amplify the toolkit’s messages and integrate them into formal and non‑formal education and outreach programmes.

## Project Structure

This repository will house all resources, documentation, and collaborative work for the toolkit. The development is organized into modular content units (see Issues) that can be developed, reviewed, and updated independently. Contributions from climate‑communication experts, educators, and subject‑matter specialists are welcome.
